Conclusion
----------

We hope you have enjoyed this guide and had fun learning about Python! Hopefully
you will continue learning and build some great programs in your future.
Computer Science is one of the few fields where you can practice at any age with
almost any level of expertise.  The best advise we can provide is to get out and
code often while having fun.  Create programs that you want to use and 
"scratch your own personal itch".  Here are a few links and books that we
recommend that you check out:
